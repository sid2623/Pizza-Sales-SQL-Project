- Listed the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

#### Intermediate Analysis:
- Joined multiple tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
- Analyzed the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
- Found the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
- Grouped orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- Identified the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

#### Advanced Analysis:
- Calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
- Analyzed the cumulative revenue generated over time.
- Determined the top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue for each pizza category.

By performing these analyses, the project provides key insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends.
